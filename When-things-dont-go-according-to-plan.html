<p>I used to be invincible when young. I would ride bikes without wearing helmets, play in the sun without sunscreen…my friends did worse. Until one day, I heard about a friend who had an accident, and then, a family member who got diagnosed with an incurable disease. I knew bad things can happen to good people but didn’t realise the consequences until it hit close to home.</p>

<p>I didn’t stop living life. But I did stop and think. What’s the risk of something bad happening to me? How can I minimise them? And if they do, what would alleviate the damage? What’s worth protecting? I am sharing what I learnt.</p>

<h3>Risk</h3>

<p>Let’s start with risk. Risk is the possibility of an uncertain outcome. Anytime you don’t know the future with complete certainty, there is a risk. The extent of the uncertainty may vary, and the range of outcomes may also vary. It’s a situation in which you are not sure whether there will be loss of a certain kind, or how much will be lost.</p>

<p>People face risks all the time…literally! You could be taking risks with your life on a daily basis when you cross the road or when you take a flight, or when you smoke. You could forget your phone at the café, or get your house broken into. These are all risks that relate to your life, health or property.</p>

<p>However, you choose to do something about some risks, and accept others. Why is this so?</p>

<p>It depends on whether you believe it’s very likely to happen or it being a remote chance? It also depends on the consequences. Will it simply cramp your style, or cause you discomfort, …or be a complete disaster? So risk is a combination of the probability of something bad happening, and the magnitude of the consequences of that event.</p>

<p>What are the big risks that everyone faces? The biggest risks are related to the biggest assets. The biggest asset you have is your body, i.e. your health or your ability to use your senses, and limbs. You need your body to enjoy life, and to earn a living. As you grow older and start a family, you collect physical assets, like a house, money, car etc, that are worth protecting because you don’t have as much time to re-build these when you are older.</p>

<h3>How to deal with risk</h3>
<p>When faced with a risk, you can do one of the following –</p>
<ul>
<li> Accept – After working out the probability and magnitude of consequences, you decide you can live with the risk. Most people are willing to accept some risks based on some gut feel, though probably can’t define what their normal acceptance risk level is. For example, you accept that flights can crash but you take flights anyway.</li>
<li> Avoid – You can choose not to put yourself in a position of risk. So eliminate the chance of loss of a certain kind by not exposing yourself to the peril. You can choose to avoid dangerous pastimes like riding motorbikes or skydiving.</li>
<li> Mitigate – You can reduce the risk by using protection, implementing controls, or other measures that have a direct effect on the risk. You can lower the frequency of the identified possible loss or lower the severity. You can wear seatbelts, helmets or sunscreen.</li>
</ul>
<p>You constantly accept, avoid and mitigate risks – probably without even realising it. But what happens if the worst happens anyway? Would money help alleviate some of the problems? Can you really rely on your family and friends to help you with money?</p>

<p>That’s where insurance comes in.</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>The basic concept of insurance is simple: The payments (or premiums) of the many pay for the losses of a few.</p>

<p>Insurance companies collect small premiums from lots of people in good times to form a large pool, and then pay out larger amounts to people who have misfortunes. So long as there are more people contributing to the pool than there are making claims, there should always be enough to pay the claims. The pool could run out if a large number of big claims occur all at once.</p>

<p>Insurance allows you to protect yourself by spreading your risk with a larger audience.</p>

<p>You can buy insurance for a number of risks – </p>
<ul>
<li> Health insurance – for reimbursement to pay for actual medical expenses for when you fall sick or have an accident; increasingly, health insurance packages encourage to take preventative measures so you don’t fall sick in the first place.</li>
<li> Income protection or disability insurance – for a pre-set monthly payment to pay for ongoing living expenses for when you fall sick or have an accident and are not able to work for an extended period of time; you could have a temporary or permanent disability. For example, if you break an arm and therefore can’t use your computer for months, but your sick leave is only two weeks.</li>
<li> Total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance – for a pre-set lump sum to pay for medical expenses, or living expenses for the last few months, if you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, or suffered a permanent debilitating damage in an accident, such that you can’t ever work again.</li>
<li> Life insurance – for a pre-set lump sum for your dependants in case you die prematurely. Your dependants may be not just your family but also business partners if you are a ‘key person’, so you can buy key-man life insurance.</li>
<li> General insurance – for reimbursement or a pre-set amount to pay for damage to your ‘stuff’ like house, car, possessions, travel, factory etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need some, or all, of these depending on your situation. You just have to think about the consequences of bad things happening, and how much money you would need for yourself or your dependents.</p>

<li>I will explain each of these in separate posts on my blog. (A word of warning – don’t mix insurance with investments – it usually leads to a mess; I will explain this in a separate post too).</li>

<p>Some things are too precious for any amount of money to help. Make sure you protect those.</p>
